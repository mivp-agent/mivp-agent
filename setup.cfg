# E231 Ignored b/c it sometimes is more readible to not include a space in multi deminsional defintions... for example: np.array([[0,0], [0,0], [0,0]])
# F541 Sometimes it is nice to use f-string s for intend matching & future use. If there is an optimization issue, it should be handled by the interpretor.
# E741 I will decide what is ambigous, thank you.
# E712 Can go either way on this
